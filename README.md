# Learn Low Level Design (LLD)

This repository is dedicated to helping you learn Low Level Design (LLD) using practical examples and free resources. Each project is designed to be extensible and scalable, adhering to SOLID principles and design patterns.

## Projects

1. **Paper Rock Scissors Game**:
   - A classic game implemented with extensibility and scalability in mind.
   - Demonstrates the application of SOLID principles and various design patterns.
   - [View Project](./PaperRockScissorsGame)

2. **Cache System with LRU Eviction Policy**:
   - A cache system that uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy.
   - Designed to be extendable and scalable, following best practices in Java.
   - [View Project](./lru-cache)

3. **Expense Sharing Application**:
   - A simplified version of the Splitwise application for managing shared expenses.
   - Built using Java with an emphasis on object-oriented principles and design patterns.
